![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad8e3904-2abe-457a-8931-e118c6d1a61c)

## Background
The bank is facing a high customer churn rate, which indicates a significant portion of its customers are discontinuing their relationships with the institution. This churn threatens the bankâ€™s growth, profitability, and long-term customer loyalty. Understanding the key drivers of churn is essential for developing targeted strategies to improve customer retention and overall satisfaction.
### Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and correlations between customer features and churn behavior. By analyzing diverse datasets encompassing transactions, demographics, customer activity, and interactions, the study aims to identify the root causes of the high churn rate. These insights will enable the bank to develop and implement suitable, targeted strategies to improve customer retention, optimize product offerings, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
 ### Questions:
 - Does a lower credit score correlate with higher churn?
 - Is there a geographical factor influencing churn?
 - Does having multiple banking products decrease the likelihood of churn?
 - Do customers with credit cards have higher churn rates than those without?
## Data Overview
The dataset comprises 10,000 rows with customer profiles, including demographic details (age, gender, geography), financial metrics (balance, credit score, salary), and behavioral attributes (activity status, product usage, credit card ownership).

## Data Preparation
- Data duplication & missing values: There are no duplicate data and missing values in the dataset.

- Feature Engineering: Extracting age group features, and transforming the data into desired form.
- Encoding: The encoding method used is ordinal encoding to convert categorical data (geography) in numerical.

## Key Insights and Findings
**1. Exit Distribution:** 
- Churned Customers: 20.4% of customers are labeled as "exited" or "churned."

- Dataset Imbalance: The dataset is imbalanced, with the majority of customers being retained (79.6%). This imbalance highlights the need for strategies focused on retaining the minority group (churned customers) - the target variable.

**2. Credit Score with Exit Variable:** The distribution of credit scores for both retained and churned customers tends to be similar, mainly clustered between scores of 600 - 700. \
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c2ef20-62a2-4921-8627-5c7eea645801)

   _Key Insight:_ Low credit score customers are more likely to churn, as all low credit score customers (below 400) fall under the churned category. 
    
**3. Age with Exited Variable:** Churned customers are concentrated in the age group of 40-55 years.

**4. Balance with Exited Variable:** Churned customers have account balances primarily ranging from 40k to 130k, while retained customers show more variation and lower concentration in balances, at zero.\

    _Key Insight:_ Surprisingly, churned customers with medium to high balances are exiting, which might suggest dissatisfaction with the products or services offered.
    
**5. Estimated Salary with Exited Variable:** No significant difference in salary distribution between churned and retained customers, with both groups concentrated around 50k to 100k.

**6. Geography with Exited:** The number of churned customer in France and Germany is similar, around 810 customers, while in Spain, it is lower at 410. However, the churn rate in Germany should be approximately 40%, which is about double the rate in France, which is around 20%.

**7. Gender with Exited:** Females exhibit a higher churn rate (11.4%) compared to males (9%).

**8. Credit Card User with Exited:**  Credit card users exhibit a higher churn rate (14.2%) compared to non-credit card users (6.1%). \

_Key Insight:_ Credit card users may be experiencing dissatisfaction with credit-related products or services. 
   
**9. Product Usage with Exited:** Approximately 14.1% of customers using only one product have churned, which is higher compared to other groups. Notably, customers using three or four products have a retention rate close to zero, with almost no retained customers in those groups.

**10. Customer Status with Exited:** Inactive customers have a higher churn rate (13.0%) compared to active customers (7.3%).

**11. Heatmap Findings:** The heatmap indicates that there is non-linear relationship between all features with the target variable (Exit). \

## Dashboard
I used Power BI to perform visualisation. At first, I 
### 1. Column Operations
- There is no significant difference in churn rate between income groups (found out by Python). So, EstimatedSalary have been removed.
- Column Rename: Columns have been renamed for clarity. For example, rename "HasCrCard" to "Credit Card", "NumOfProducts" to "No.Products" and so on.
- Value Replacement: For clarity, I replace all binary values (0 vs 1 ) with suitable values. For example, replace 0 to  "Inactive" and 1 to "Active" in "Active Member" column, replace 0 to "Retained" and 1 to "Churned" in "Exited" column and so on. \

### 2. Data Normalisation
In this project, I applied data normalization techniques to restructure the dataset for churn analysis, transforming it into a star schema to enhance efficiency, reduce redundancy, and improve analytical capabilities. The normalization process followed a systematic approach to organize data into fact and dimension tables. 
The dataset was divided into a fact table and multiple dimension tables:
The dataset was normalized into a fact table and several dimension tables as follows:
- Fact Table: A fact_churn table was created to contain transactional and measurable data, including CustomerID, ChurnStatus, and foreign keys linking to the dimension tables.
  
- Dimension Tables: Descriptive tables were designed to represent additional attributes:\
  Dim_Country: Captured geographical details, including Country and CountryId.\
  Dim_Balance: Included account-related attributes, such as BalanceRange and BalanceRangeID.\
  Dim_Age: Grouped customers into age brackets for analysis (e.g., AgeGroup vs AgeGroupID).\
  Dim_CreditScore: Classified credit scores into ranges (CreditScore Range), CreditScore Level and CreditScoreID. 
  
The model was built by establishing primary and foreign key relationships between the fact_churn table and the dimension tables, adhering to the principles of a star schema. This ensured a clear and efficient structure, enabling seamless querying and analysis. \

### 3. Dashboard - Visualisation
I started building dashboard by creating some measures which are stored in **_Measure** table.
First, I created a measure named **No.Customers** by right clicking on **Fact_Churn**, then choosing **New Measure**. The measure counts the number of bank customers defined by the following formula:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4e9fda-88fd-4f20-b31e-8e3590fefe75)

Following the initial step, I created **No.Inactive Members**,**No.Churned Customers**, **No.Active Members** and **%Chured Customers** with the respective formulars below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da6449c2-5720-471b-ab65-37b0bcb293cb)

Eventually, I developed a dashboard (shown in the screenshot below) that delves into key features such as account balance, age group, activity status, and credit score, analyzing their impact on the churn rate. This dashboard allowed me to visualize and interpret how these factors influence customer retention, helping to identify patterns and insights that could drive strategic improvements.

## Recommendation
**1.** The bank should consider retirement-focused financial products, investment planning tools, or age-targeted advisory services to retain customers in this age group.\
**2.** The bank should revisit its product bundling strategy, making sure that customers with multiple products feel they are receiving sufficient value. Alternatively, it may be useful to personalize bundles and create more flexible options.\
**3.** A thorough investigation into customer satisfaction and service quality in Germany should be conducted. The bank should focus on improving its customer support and perhaps reconsider its product offerings in Germany to align with local needs and expectations.\
**4.** The bank should develop re-engagement strategies to target inactive customers, such as personalized outreach, special offers, or financial consultations, to re-engage them and reduce churn.
