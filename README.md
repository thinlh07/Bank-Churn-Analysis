## Findings
 **1. Credit Score with Exit Variable:** The distribution of credit scores for both retained and churned customers tends to be similar, mainly clustered between scores of 600 - 700.
- Key Insight: Low credit score customers are more likely to churn, as all low credit score customers (below 600) fall under the churned category.
 **2. Age with Exited Variable:** Churned customers are concentrated in the age group of 40-55 years. 
 **3. Balance with Exited Variable:** Churned customers have account balances primarily ranging from 40k to 130k, while retained customers show more variation and lower concentration in balances, at zero.
- **Estimated Salary with Exited Variable:** There is no difference on salary distribution of retained and churned customer, which are concentrated around 50k -100k.
- **Geography with Exited:** The number of churned customer in France and Germany is similar, around 810 customers, while in Spain, it is lower at 410. However, the churn rate in Germany should be approximately 40%, which is about double the rate in France, which is around 20%.

- **Product Usage with Exited:** Approximately 14.1% of customers using only one product have churned, which is higher compared to other groups. Notably, customers using three or four products have a retention rate close to zero, with almost no retained customers in those groups.
- **Customer Status with Exited:** No surprise that Inactive members have a higher churn rate than active members, at 13.0% and 7.3% respectively.
## Recommendation
- The bank should consider introducing typical products for customers who are approaching retirement age.
- Nearly all customers with three or more products have churned, highlighting a potential failure in the bank's product diversification strategy. Stakeholders should prioritize investigating the root causes and focus on improving service quality while adopting a more targeted and customer-centric approach to product offerings.
